Currently these technologies are implemented as polyfills or shims, but as browsers adopt these features natively, the platform code that drives Polymer evacipates, leaving only the value-adds.\n\n## Tools & Testing\n\nFor running tests or building minified files, consult the [tooling information](https://www.polymer-project.org/resources/tooling-strategy.html).\n\n## Releases\n\n[Release (tagged) versions](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/releases) of Polymer include concatenated and minified sources for your convenience.\n\n[![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-39334307-2/Polymer/polymer/README)](https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon)\n",
